Python Function:
***************
organized block of reusable code that called whenever required

divide large program into basic building blocks

Re-usability of codes and modularity in program

The function contains the set of programming statements enclosed
by {}

keyword - def



Types of functions:
******************

1. user-defined function
     - created by user to perform specific task
2. Built-in-function
     - predefined function in Python like max(),count() etc
3. Anonymous function


Advantages:
**********

avoid rewriting same logic/code again and again in a program
call functions multiply times anywhere in program
re-usablity of code
track large Python program easily when it is divided into
multiple functions.

Syntax:
1. def my_function(parameters):
2. function_block
3. return expression

● The def keyword, along with the function name is used to define the
function.
● The identifier rule must follow the function name.
● A function accepts the parameter (argument), and they can be optional.
● The function block is started with the colon (:), and block statements
must be at the same indentation.
● The return statement is used to return the value. A function can have
only one return

Function calling:
****************
A function must be defined before the function call; otherwise, the Python
interpreter gives an error. To call the function, use the function name followed
by the parentheses.

    The return statement is used at the end of the function and returns the result of
the function. It terminates the function execution and transfers the result where
the function is called. The return statement cannot be used outside of the
function.
    If the return statement has no expression or does not exist itself
in the function then it returns the None object.

Arguments in function:
*********************

Information which can be passed into the function.

The arguments are specified in the parentheses.

Pass any number of arguments, separated them with a comma.

Call by reference in Python:
***************************

In Python, call by reference means passing the actual value as an argument in
the function. All the functions are called by reference, i.e., all the changes made
to the reference inside the function revert back to the original value referred by
the reference.
