Decorators :
- used to simplify function
- to modify function without changing the actual behaviour of that function
- call with "@" symbol
- Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behaviour
 of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.

- i.e  allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without
modifying its structure.
- The outer function is called the decorator, which takes the original
 function as an argument and returns a modified version of it.

- Decorators are usually called before the definition of a function to decorate.

- Function:
  >> everything in Python is an object, even functions are objects.
  A function is an instance of the Object type.
You can store the function in a variable.
You can pass the function as a parameter to another function.
You can return the function from a function.
You can store them in data structures such as hash tables, lists, â€¦

Chaining Decorators in Python
